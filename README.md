# State Farm Competition Instructions

Welcome to State Farm's game dev competition at ASU GameCon 2020! To compete, follow the instructions below for forking and modifying this base game and then submitting your modification for consideration. There are two Nintendo Switch Lites up for grabs for the best modification of the base game. We'll be judging your contributions based on the following criteria:

- Fun Factor
- Creativity / Innovation
- Degree of Change
- Quality
- Completeness
 
 For example, you might decide to update the artwork in an interesting way and earn yourself major points for Creativity but not be awarded much for Degree of Change. Other possible ideas for changing the game include:
 
- Add scoring
- Create barriers that change the way the hero falls
- Add a health mechanic
- Create a title screen
- Make a way to lose and/or a way to win

This game runs on the [Phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) JavaScript game framework. You can see a running version of this base game [here](https://statefarmasugamecon.github.io/BaseGame/). All credit for the code and art in this base game goes to Emanuele Feronato's [One Tap RPG tutorial](https://www.emanueleferonato.com/2019/02/18/html5-prototype-of-one-tap-rpg-game-built-with-phaser-3-and-matter-js/).
